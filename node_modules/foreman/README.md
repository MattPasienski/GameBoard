# Node Foreman

Node Foreman is a Node.js version of the popular 
[Foreman](http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/) tool,
with a few Node specific changes.

> Foreman is a manager for Procfile-based applications. 
> Its aim is to abstract away the details of the Procfile 
> format, and allow you to either run your application 
> directly or export it to some other process management format.

## Install

Install the command line tool

    $ npm install -g foreman

## Usage

Node Foreman can be run with as little as `nf start`, as long as `npm start` has been defined.
For more complicated applications you will want to define a `Procfile` for your various server
processes and and a `.env` file to preload environmental variables.

Your module directory should end up looking like the following:

    /
    ├─ .env
    ├─ package.js
    ├─ server.js # or whatever you call your application
    ├─ Procfile

Once your Procfile is defined, run your application with `nf start`:

    $ nf start
    
    18:51:12: web.1     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5000
    18:51:13: api.1     |  Api Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5100
    18:51:13: log.1     |  Log Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5200

Node Foreman _always_ start in the foreground and expects your applications
to do the same. If your processes exit, Node Foreman will assume an error
has ocurred and shut your application down.

Instead of daemonizing, you should use `nf export` to ready your application
for production.

For more information try any of the following:

	$ nf --help
	$ nf start --help
	$ nf export --help

### Procfile

The `Procfile` format is a simple `key : command` format:
    
    web: node web_server.js
    api: node api_server.js
    log: node log_server.js

Each line should contain a separate process.

### Environmental Variables

Create a `.env` file to pre-load environmental variables with the format:

    MYSQL_NAME=superman
    MYSQL_PASS=cryptonite

The equivalent `.env` file may alternatively be a valid JSON document:

    {
        "mysql":{
            "name": "superman",
            "pass": "cryptonite"
        }
    }

The above JSON document will be flattened into env variables by 
concatenating the nested values with an underscore.
Environmental variables are passed in fully capitalized.

    {
        "mysql":{
            "name": "superman",     # => MYSQL_NAME=superman
            "pass": "cryptonite"    # => MYSQL_PASS=cryptonite
        }
    }

There is no need to specify which type of file you wish to use.

#### Best Practices

Generally you should not check your `.env` file into version control.
The `.env` file contain _only_ parameters that depend on where the application
gets deployed. It should not contain anything related to _how_ the application
is deployed.

For example, good candiates for the `.env` file are MySQL connection information,
port bindings, and other passwords.

Bad candidates are default configurations that do not contain any location-specific
information.

### Advanced Usage

Node Foreman lets you start multiple jobs of the same type:

    $ nf start web=5
    
    18:51:12: web.1     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5000
    18:51:12: web.2     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5001
    18:51:12: web.3     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5002
    18:51:12: web.4     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5003
    18:51:12: web.5     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5004

Each job will be started as its own process, receiving a different `PORT`
environmental variable. 
The port number for processes of the same type will be offset by 1.
The port number for processes of different types will be offset by 100.

    $ nf start web=2,api=2
    
    18:51:12: web.1     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5000
    18:51:12: web.2     |  Web Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5001
    18:51:12: api.1     |  Api Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5100
    18:51:12: api.2     |  Api Server started listening on 0.0.0.0:5101

## Export to Production

Node Foreman is designed to be in a development environment,
however it can export an Upstart job for use in production.
The Upstart file has _no_ dependency on Node Foreman.

    $ nf export
    Loaded ENV .env File as JSON Format
    Wrote  :  ./foreman-web-1.conf
    Wrote  :  ./foreman-web.conf
    Wrote  :  ./foreman-api-1.conf
    Wrote  :  ./foreman-api.conf
    Wrote  :  ./foreman-log-1.conf
    Wrote  :  ./foreman-log.conf
    Wrote  :  ./foreman.conf

You can inspect your upstart files before placing them in the right
directory, or have foreman do it for you:

    $ sudo nf export -o /etc/init
    Loaded ENV .env File as JSON Format
    Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-api-1.conf
    Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-web.conf
    Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-api.conf
    Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-log.conf
    Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-log-1.conf
    Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman-web-1.conf
    Wrote  :  /etc/init/foreman.conf

Start and stop your jobs with

    $ sudo start JOBNAME
    $ sudo stop JOBNAME

The export will occur with whatever environmental variables are 
listed in the .env file.

You can specify the type and number of processes exported using 
the `type=num` syntax:

    $ nf export -a JOBNAME -o /etc/init web=2,api=2

Use `-u <USER>` to have the exported job run as `USER`.
Note that if you need to bind to privileged ports, you _must_
start as `root`. In such a case, we advise you to drop user
permissions after binding.

## Scalability

Node.js applications scale by creating multiple processes that either 
share a socket, or sit behind a load balancer.
Node Foreman can help you test the parallel capabilities of your application
by spawning multiple processes behind a round-robin proxy automatically.

	$ nf start -x 8888 web=5
	[OKAY] Starting Proxy Server 8888 -> 5000-5004

Access your application from port `8888` and the connections will be balanced
across the servers started from ports `5000` - `5004`.

If your application gets its port number from `process.env.PORT` the proxy
setup will ocurr automatically.

## Security

_This Section is Alpha_

Node Foreman disallows applications from starting on privileged ports.
It does however allow proxies to be bound to lower ports, such as port 80.

If you require access to a privileged port, start Node Foreman with `sudo`:

	$ sudo nf start -x 80 web=5
	[OKAY] Starting Proxy Server 80 -> 5000-5004

Your application will then be accessible via port 80.

Your applications will _still_ be started in user space, and the proxy will
drop its privileges after binding to the privileged port.
